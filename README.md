This project created a mobile-responsive, cross-browser compatible frontend for Pebble Solutions Ltd, showcasing their mission statement and ethos, succes stories and information about the team members that make that success happen. 

While the code is visible and available during development, this is subject to change at any stage. All contributions are from Christopher Kennedy (chriswkennedy@icloud.com).

I am currently looking for development work - I work with React.JS (+Native, +Redux), HTML, ES6+ JavaScript, CSS, Ruby on Rails and multiple SQL interfaces, having hosted with postgreSQL. Please don't hesitate to reach out!
