This project creates a useful and attractive front-end for Pebble Solutions Ltd, showcasing their mission statement and ethos, succes stories and information about the team members that make that success happen. 

While the code is visible and available during development, this is subject to change. All contributions are from Christopher William Kennedy (chriswkennedy@icloud.com).

I am currently looking for development work - I am talented with React.JS (+Native, +Redux), HTML, ES6+ JavaScript, CSS, Ruby on Rails and multiple SQL interfaces, having hosted with postgreSQL. Please don't hesitate to reach out!
